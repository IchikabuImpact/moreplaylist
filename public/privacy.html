<p>The following is an explanation of how the MorePlaylist application accesses, uses, stores, or shares Google user data.</p>

<p>MorePlaylist uses the YouTube API to authenticate accounts, </p>
<p>and we have implemented a policy of not retaining user data used for login authentication in databases or other storage systems.</p>
<p> Additionally, we do not use this data for any secondary purposes.</p>

<p>For the use of Google user data obtained through Restricted Scope and Sensitive Scope, we adhere to the Limited Use Policy.</p>
</section>

<section>
<H3>Limited Use Policy:</h3>

<p>We comply with the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the requirements of the Limited Use Policy.</p>

<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a></p>

<p>When requesting Google user data, we ensure that the credentials used to access Google API services are kept confidential.</p>
<p> If we need to access user data of a type not explicitly stated in the Developer Privacy Policy at the time the Google user originally authorized access,</p>
<p> we will update the Privacy Policy and ask the user to consent to the change.</p>

<h3>The MorePlaylist application uses two API scopes:</h3>
<p>When users use the More Playlist application, 
they may be asked to grant permission to access their playlists via the YouTube API.</p>
<p>This permission allows the application to retrieve information about the playlists uploaded by the user. </p>
<p>However, we will not share the user's information with any third party, nor will we use the information obtained for any purpose other than that of the user.</p>
<p>To ensure the security of the information obtained,
 we use SSL encryption for transmission and take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect it.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl">https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl</a></p>
<p>The purpose of the MorePlaylist application is to request user data to read the playlists used by the user's YouTube account. </p>

<h4>How to use the two api scopes:</h4>
<p>1. read the playlists held in your account.</p>
<p>2. retrieve the name given to your playlist and the ID of the playlist, and
Display them in the application's pull-down.</p>
<p>3. These processes are implemented using google-api-php-client.</p>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-php-client">google-api-php-client</a></p>
<p>4. moreplaylist stores the acquired authentication information only in the session.</p>
<p>Although the application requests data for this specific purpose, we do not use that data for any secondary purpose. authentication data is destroyed when the session expires.</p>

<p>While the application requests data for this specific purpose, we do not use that data for any secondary purposes.</p>
